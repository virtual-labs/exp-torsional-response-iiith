Start the experiment with the default values of mass and stiffness for all 4 sections as well as force direction. Pause the experiment after a few cycles and note the observation. In the top view(press 'Toggle View' to access this) of the building, the red dot represents the centre of mass(COM) and the blue dot represents the centre of stiffness/resistance(COR). It is recommended to use the top view for a better understanding. Also note that stiffness has a much greater influence than mass in building torsion and hence when both mass and stiffness values are changed, the rotation shown is solely based on the COR and not on COM.

**Observation 1:**
 1. Vary the mass of the various sections and note the change in rotation/torsion direction.
 2. You may note the position of the COM in the top view and the corresponding rotation direction.

**Observation 2:**
 1. Vary the stiffness of the various sections and note the change in rotation/torsion direction.
 2. You may note the position of the COR in the top view and the corresponding rotation direction.

**Observation 3:**
 1. Vary the direction of external force and note the change in rotation/torsion direction for fixed mass and stiffness values.
 2. You may note the position of the COR and COM in the top view, the force direction and the corresponding rotation direction.

**NOTE:**
 1. The simulation does not start until the parameters are changed to make the building unsymmetrical in some way such as by imbalanced positions of the COM and COR.
 2. The side view looks like a table but it represents a building with 4 pillars.
