Here mass of slab is given as 4 parts and stiffness as 4 parts in both directions. Experiment starts with default values of masses and stiffnesses. Observe the SDOF response in 3 directions (2 translations and 1 rotation/torsion)

**Observation 1:**
Here in this stage, user can change mass of slab corresponding to default value by keeping all other as default values. Observe the difference in 3 directions response.
